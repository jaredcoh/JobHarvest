# JobHarvest

JobHarvest is a handy Chrome extension designed to streamline your job search process by efficiently managing job alerts from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed in your Gmail. This program uses the Gmail and Google Sheets API to parse your email's HTML and send it directly to your Google Sheet.

## Features

- **Consolidated Alerts**: JobHarvest aggregates job alerts from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed, making it easier for you to manage them all in one place.
  
- **Customized Filtering**: With JobHarvest, you can apply filters to automatically hide jobs that do not align with your career path, ensuring that you only receive relevant opportunities.
  
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily copy job listings to your clipboard or export them directly to your spreadsheet for further analysis and organization.

## How to Use

Follow these simple steps to activate JobHarvest:

1. **Download**: Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jobharvest/hdakckfgkfmgphnldhhajbibmfhnfcig) to download the JobHarvest extension to your Chrome browser.
  
2. **Preference Features**: After installation, open the extension. Make sure to view the preferences to optimize your functionality
  - **Time Between Badge Updates** - checks your Gmail periodically to determine how many Job Alert emails you have
 - **Number of Inbox Emails to Check** - Instead of checking your extremely long inbox, you can limit your search to save time and computing power
 - **Phrases to Ignore** - Filter out the words you do not want to see in your Company or Job Title
- **Sheets Information** - Provide the Sheets URL, Sheets Tab, and Column Range so the information gets placed in the correct sheet! (Data must not have empty rows or else rows will overwrite)
- **Combine Into One Table?** - If you want to see the data all in one table, as opposed to per email use the checkbox provided!
- **Column Organization** - Everyone organizes their tables differently, so you should have the flexibility to choose the order you like! (It is not recommended to have spaces between data columns)
  
3. **Search Your Email**: Click on the "Search Your Email" button to retrieve job alerts from your linked accounts on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed.
  
4. **Delete and Filter**: Review your job alerts and delete any unwanted listings. Apply filters to refine your search criteria according to your preferences.
  
5. **Copy or Export**: Once you've filtered your alerts, you can either copy the selected listings to your clipboard or export them directly to your preferred spreadsheet application.

With JobHarvest, managing and organizing your job alerts has never been easier. Streamline your job search process and stay focused on finding the perfect opportunity!

Happy job hunting! ðŸŒŸ

## Inquiries, Support, and Privacy Policy

For any inquiries, please use the button in the extension. 

This is an open-source project, and I would like any help possible to improve its functionality -- especially in expanding the job alert emails that can be parsed. If you are interested in working on this project, feel free to reach out to me directly or add an issue/pull request!

I am working on getting JobHarvest verified through the Google Console. The application is still usable, you will 'Proceed' past Google's warnings to ensure proper use.
